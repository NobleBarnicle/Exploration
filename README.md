# Exploration
This is my attempt to go from zero coding knowledge to working with Python, machine learning, neural net's, AI. 

I am a lawyer who is excited about these topics and so I have decided to dive into working with them. Initial efforts will focus on Andrej Karpathy's micrograd/miniGPT to build intuition around how these work and how to train a model and then fine tune it on a topic. Long term I want to work with open source models and fine tune them on a topic of my choosing, probably legal case law. 

I am working on this in my spare time outside of work.
